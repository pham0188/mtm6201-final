## Website Development Process

I began the process of building this website by exporting the frames designed in Figma as references. During the coding phase, I continuously accessed the Bootstrap library to add classes for elements such as margins, padding, and the column system. Last but not least, I validated my code to make sure that there was no error.

Applying Bootstrap to the HTML was straightforward for me; however, the real challenge arose when styling a few components, particularly the buttons, in CSS. To change the color of a button, I had to inspect it, locate all the related variables, and modify them at `:root`. This process was time-consuming and made it easy to miss a variable. In the future, I plan to use Sass or another CSS library to style the buttons more efficiently.

The most important lesson I learned during the creation of this web portfolio was that writing code in a neat and systematic way makes it easier to modify any element later.
